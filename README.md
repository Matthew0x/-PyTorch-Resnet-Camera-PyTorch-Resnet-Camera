## Camera feed with object recognition

This is an old mini-project I found in somewhere, then started working on. I will likely continue to do something with it.
It lacks the FPS counter, target indicators and has a pretty poor object recognition (unless I am in fact a hand_blower, then it's 100% accurate).

I am much sorry for not crediting the person I initially took it from, but I simply forgot where I got the example.
